There once was a hunter who lived in a small cabin in the woods with his wife and their three sons. They were very poor, but happy. Now it happened that one day, while the hunter was off selling pelts in the village at the other side of the woods, that his wife fell deathly ill. The hunter's sons knew of a wise woman who lived nearby, and so resolved to go to her for help.

"Old wise woman," they called when they reached her hut. "Our mother is deathly ill, and our father is away. Please help us."

The wise woman's heart was warmed by their pleas, and so she agreed to help. "It is a powerful spell that I need. I shall require three things: water from a magic well, the location of which I shall tell you, glowing mushrooms from a cave that lies not far from there, and the veil of a bride on her wedding day. If you fetch me these things, I shall save your mother."

The hunter's sons were overjoyed at this, and eagerly agreed to set out.

"Be warned," said the old woman. "When dealing with whoever or whatever watches over these three things, remember to deal with each accordingly. It is not always best to be earnest and true, sometimes it is best to be deceptive and cunning. Still others it is best to tell only half-truths, as not all shall fall for lies. Pay attention to the nature of those you deal with."

The hunter's sons thanked the woman for her advice, and set off first to find the magic well.
