$!{once_again}the three brothers came across a small chapel. They could see people bustling about busily, and it was plain to see that a wedding was about to take place. From the conversations they could overhear, the bride was the daughter of ${desc}, and the girl was much like her father. Who the groom was, they could not tell. They knew it was their chance to retrieve a veil from a bride, and so resolved to do so.

$!{the_brother} went forth to find the bride. He soon found her, sitting by a stream. Her veil lay next to her on the grass.
