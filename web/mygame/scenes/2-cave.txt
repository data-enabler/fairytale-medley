The three brothers ${once_again}found themselves at the mouth of the cave. Its gaping maw held nothing but blackness, giving no hint to the outside world of the glowing treasure it contained.

$!{the_brother} crept forward into the cave until he was swallowed by the darkness. He walked and walked until he saw a green light just ahead of him.

"The mushrooms!" exclaimed the hunter's son.

He gathered a bunch and shoved them in his pocket, then plucked a single glowing mushroom to help him see on his way out.

When he reached the mouth of the cave, he found his escape blocked by ${desc}.
