The brothers returned home in a great depression, knowing that they had failed to gather the ingredients for the magical cure. They stayed with their mother, and kept her as comfortable as they could, but soon she passed away.

The hunter returned to house in mourning. When he heard what at happened, he fell to his knees as sorrow wracked his frame. "You did what you could," he told his sons. "I only wish I had been here to help, or at least say goodbye."

The hunter and his three sons held each other, weeping, and their mourning was so great that the birds stopped singing throughout the whole wood, in respect. And that is how the hunter's wife died.
